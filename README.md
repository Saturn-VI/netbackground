it mostly just looks fancy
## features (there's like 3)
- it automatically styles and sets up a container with id 'background-container'
- it treats your cursor as a point and makes it stronger (pretty much a given)
- you can sort of change the variables at the start, but then the regressions need to be re-calculated

## todo
- making the regressions automatic
- fix the flash that happens when page is resized (low priority)
- make more particles spawn at mouse when clicked
