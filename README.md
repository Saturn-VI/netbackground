it mostly just looks fancy
## features (there's like 3)
- it automatically styles and sets up a container with id 'background-container'
- it treats your cursor as a point and makes it stronger (pretty much a given)
- you can sort of change the variables at the start, but then the regressions need to be re-calculated
- particles spawn at the cursor when mouse is clicked
- somewhat well done scaling

## todo
- scale maxrange to screen size (now it scales to speed of points)
- scale basically everything
